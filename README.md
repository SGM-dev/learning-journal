## Introduction

The learning journal is designed to track and record my progress and insights while learning web development. It serves as a personal log to reflect on my experiences, challenges, and achievements throughout the learning journey.

## Requirements

To meet the project requirements, the following steps have been implemented:

1. **Build from Scratch**: All the pages in the journal have been created from scratch, using the design provided in the Figma file. This ensures a consistent and personalized look and feel.

2. **Responsive Design**: The project employs responsive design techniques to ensure optimal viewing experience across different devices. The following strategies have been used:

   - **Relative Units**: Relative units, such as percentages and ems, have been utilized for sizing elements, allowing them to adapt to different screen sizes.

   - **Mobile-First Design**: The design approach begins with mobile devices in mind, ensuring that the pages are optimized for small screens and progressively enhanced for larger screens.

   - **Media Queries**: CSS media queries have been applied to modify the layout and styling based on different viewport widths. This enables a seamless transition between different screen sizes.

   - **Viewport Meta Tag**: The viewport meta tag has been included to control the width and scaling of the page on various devices. It ensures that the content is displayed correctly and responsively.

## Stretch Goals

In addition to the project requirements, the following stretch goals have been accomplished:

1. **Content about Learning Experience**: The learning journal not only includes my personal insights but also focuses on documenting my learning experiences. This provides a comprehensive overview of my progress and the challenges encountered.

2. **Custom Images**: Custom images have been added throughout the journal to enhance the visual appeal and convey information effectively. These images supplement the written content and make the journal more engaging.

3. **New Pages**: Additional pages have been created to accommodate a diverse range of topics and concepts related to web development. These new pages allow for a more comprehensive documentation of my learning journey.

4. **View More Posts**: The journal incorporates a "View More" functionality that displays other recent posts when clicked. This feature enhances navigation and enables easy access to previous entries, improving the overall user experience.

5. **Responsive Navigation**: The navigation menu is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. On smaller screens, a hamburger menu is displayed, allowing users to access the menu easily. This ensures that the journal remains user-friendly across various devices.
